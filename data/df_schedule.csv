2019-08-22 - Thursday,10:00 AM - 10:20 AM,Auditorium,Using R for Generic Drug Evaluation and SABE R-package for Assessing Bioequivalence of Topical Dermatological Products,Elena Rantou,"Determination of bioequivalence (BE), a crucial part of the evaluation of generic drugs, may depend on clinical endpoint studies, pharmacokinetic (PK) studies of bioavailability, and In-Vitro tests, among others. Additionally, in reviewing Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDA), FDA reviewers often analyze safety studies and perform various kinds of simulations. A growing, vibrant group of statisticians in the Office of Biostatistics, CDER/FDA has adopted R for both their routine tasks and to address numerous scientific questions that are received in the form of internal consults. During the past 5 years, we have used R to run power simulations; generate the distribution of certain statistics of interest; assess the similarity of and cluster amino-acid sequences as well as, derive the distribution of the molecular weight of such sequences of a certain length; and determine the validity of data sets categorized for genotoxicity. R-package SABE was developed to accompany a new statistical test, used to assess BE of topical dermatological products when data for evaluation come from the In-Vitro Permeation Test (IVPT) [1]. BE tests consider comparisons between a Test (usually generic) and a Reference (RLD) product under a replicate study design. A function that assesses BE of a Test and a Reference formulation uses a mixed scaled criterion for the PK metrics AUC (Area Under the Curve) and Cmax (maximum concentration)."

2019-08-22 - Thursday,10:30 AM - 10:50 AM,Auditorium,Teaching an old dog new tricks: modernizing gsDesign,Keaven Anderson,"The gsDesign package for group sequential design is widely used with >30k downloads. The package was originally written in 2007 with substantial documentation and Runit testing created before 2010. A Shiny interface was created to make the package more approachable in about 2015. Recent efforts have focused on updating package to use Roxygen2, pkgdown, covr/covrpage and testthat as well as changing vignettes from Sweave to R Markdown. The learning curve for this modernization will be discussed as well as usage in a regulated environment."

2019-08-22 - Thursday,11:30 AM - 11:40 AM,Auditorium,Creating and reviving Shiny apps with {golem},Eric Nantz,"Developing Shiny applications that meet design goals, easily deploy to multiple platforms, and contain easily maintainable components (all while adhering to best practices) is typically a difficult endeavor. Until recently, there has not been a tool addressing the optimal development workflow and construction of Shiny apps. The {golem} package by Think-R offers an opinionated framework for creating a Shiny app as a package, with {usethis}-like functionality to add a diverse set of capabilities. In this presentation, I will share how {golem} enables a robust standard for Shiny development and how it magically brought a dormant application back to life."
2019-08-22 - Thursday,11:40 AM - 12:00 PM,Auditorium,Exploratory Graphics (xGx): Promoting the purposeful exploration of PKPD data,Alison Margolskee,"Introduction: As pharmacometricians, we sometimes jump into complex modeling before thoroughly exploring our data. This can happen due to tight timelines, lack of ready-to-use graphic tools or enthusiasm for complex models. Exploratory plots can help to uncover useful insights in the data and identify aspects to be explored further through modeling or in future studies. Exploratory plots can even quickly answer questions without the need of a complex model, improving our efficiency and providing timely impact on project strategy. The Exploratory Graphics (xGx) tool is an open-source R-based tool, freely available on GitHub [1]. Intuitively organized by datatype and driven by analysis questions, the tool aims to encourage a question-based approach to data exploration focusing on the key questions relevant to dose-exposure-response analyses. Objectives: • Facilitate the purposeful exploration of PKPD data • Encourage a question-based approach to data exploration, focusing on dose-exposure-response relationships • Provide a teaching tool for people new to PKPD analysis Methods: PK (single and multiple ascending dose), and PD (continuous, time-to-event, categorical, count, and ordinal) data were simulated and formatted according to a typical PKPD modeling dataset format. Lists of key questions relevant to dose-exposure-response exploration were compiled, and exploratory plots were generated to answer each question. The graphs were created following good graphics principles to ensure quality and consistency in our graphical communications [2]. Results: Examples of the key analysis questions include: • Provide an overview of the data: - What type of data is it (e.g. continuous, binary, categorical)? - How many doses? - What is the range of doses explored? - For PK data, how many potential compartments are observed? - Is the exposure dose-proportional? - Is there evidence of nonlinearity in clearance? • Assess the variability: - How large is the between subject variability compared to between dose separation? - Can any of the between subject variability be attributed to any covariates? - Are there any patterns in the within subject variability (e.g. circadian rhythms, seasonal effects, food effects, underlying disease progression)? • Assess the dose/exposure-response relationship: - Is there evidence of a correlation between dose/exposure and response? - Is the relationship positive or negative? - Is there a plateau or maximal effect in the observed dose/exposure range? - Is there evidence of a delay between exposure and response? For each datatype in the simulated dataset, plots were generated to answer these key questions. The plots along with the codes to produce them were compiled into a user friendly interface. The tool is intuitively organized by datatype and driven by the analysis questions. Since the graphs were generated based on a typical modeling dataset format and hosted online, they can be easily accessed and applied to new projects. Conclusion: Exploratory plots were generated, built around typical key questions particularly relevant to dose-exposure-response exploration and compiled into a user friendly interface. The Exploratory Graphics (xGx) tool can help underscore the role of purposeful data exploration for quantitative scientists. Through a question-based approach, xGx helps uncover useful insights that can be revealed without complex modeling and identify aspects of the data that may be explored further.

2019-08-22 - Thursday,12:00 PM - 12:10 PM,Auditorium,Interactive Visualization of Standardized CDISC-SEND-Formatted Toxicology Study Data Using R Shiny,Kevin Snyder,"The standardization of nonclinical study data by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) via the Standard for Exchange of Nonclinical Data (SEND) has created an opportunity for the collaborative development and use of open source software solutions to analyze and visualize toxicology study data. Shiny is an open source R package that facilitates the development of user-friendly, web-based applications. The Pharmaceutical Users Software Exchange (PhUSE) consortium has provided a platform for stakeholders throughout the pharmaceutical industry to collaboratively build and share tools, e.g. R Shiny applications, to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of drug development. The modeling of standard repeat-dose toxicology study endpoints, e.g. body weights, clinical signs, clinical pathology, histopathology, toxicokinetics, etc., in SEND has created new opportunities for dynamic, interactive visualization of study data above and beyond the static tables and figures typically included in static study reports. For example, clinical pathology data from nonclinical toxicology studies can be difficult to digest when presented as group means in data tables, due to the large number of potentially correlated analytes collected across treatment groups, sexes, and potentially multiple timepoints. An R Shiny application has been developed to allow end users to comprehensively examine these datasets, using a variety of analytical and visualization methods, with relative ease. The application is publicly hosted on shinyapps.io, and the source code can be found on the PhUSE GitHub website."
2019-08-22 - Thursday,12:10 PM - 12:30 PM,Auditorium,Using RStudio.Cloud to advance R proficiency: a crowdsourcing training experience,Paulo Bargo,"As the Pharmaceutical sector boosts its interactions with regulatory agencies using R programming as one key instrument for drug development submissions, we face a dilemma that several members of statistics and statistical programming teams are not currently advanced R programmers. For many years SAS has been a powerful tool in the data analysis repertoire of pharma statisticians however the recent development of automation capabilities such as RMarkdown and R/Shiny have created a new venue to expedite access to consumable information in the form of reports, presentations or interactive graphics that can be produced efficiently and in standard format for all phases of a drug development or submission process. At Janssen we aim to improve the literacy in R programming and achieve nearly 100% adhesion by statistics and statistical programming teams in the coming 2-3 years. To achieve this goal, we are leveraging all types of training formats, from online training, to in-house instructor led seminar, to one-on-one mentoring. One of the key methods we have been developing is the use of RStudio.Cloud as a platform for internal crowd-led hands-on workshops where statisticians/programmers are ""thought"" to solve on-the-job real problems ranging from visualization to automated reports. In this presentation we will discuss our experience creating this program and share lessons learned, mistakes and successes."

2019-08-22 - Thursday,1:30 PM - 1:50 PM,Auditorium,Updates on Analyzing Clinical Trials Data with R,Adrian Waddell,"At R in Pharma 2018, I gave a workshop and a presentation on analyzing clinical trials data with R. Since then much has happened at Roche/Genentech with regard to analyzing clinical trials data with R: our R-based projects got funded in order to extend our R tools and make them production ready. Since then we have created an R developer team that uses the SCRUM framework to work on our R tools. We also have subject-matter expert teams that translate the business knowledge into documentation and R code. Much effort has gone into setting up a CI/CD environment and defining a GitHub workflow that enabled our teams to collaborate efficiently and to keep the code quality high. In this presentation, I will first introduce the team structures, workflows, CI/CD environment and give some updates on the software development side. Finally, I will conclude with a brief update on our discussions around open sourcing and collaboration within the pharma industry and use this opportunity to start a conversation with the audience."

The guide is traditionally authored using MS Word—a 100% manual and labor intensive process with its inherent shortcomings often exposed and aggravated during the usually frenzied sponsor submission process. R offers a more efficient solution with greater reproducibility: Programmatic document generation facilitated by Shiny and R Markdown. Shiny not only manages R Markdown knitting but gives the sponsor staff, who oftentimes are unfamiliar with R, the ability to quickly leverage R with just a crash course in Markdown. An example of applying Shiny and R Markdown to generate the Study Data Reviewer's Guide for Clinical Data will be presented."
2019-08-22 - Thursday,2:30 PM - 2:50 PM,Auditorium,Collaborating at scale: managing an enterprise analytical computing ecosystem,Rena Yang,"In a large organization, collaboration faces many obstacles. Groups may inadvertently reinvent functionality and expend redundant effort. Siloing may impede aggregation and comparison of results. Analysts may not be aware of potential collaborators. However, a shared computational analysis environment, supported by centrally developed infrastructure and well-defined policies, enables discoverability, facilitates reuse, promotes communication between analysts, and improves comparability of results. We will present how we are pursuing this vision at Genentech."
2019-08-22 - Thursday,2:50 PM - 3:00 PM,Auditorium,Embrace R in Pharma - building internal R community and establishing fit-for-purpose R pilots,Ning Leng,"R is the dominant language in modern quantitative science, however it is still not widely used in pharma industry. In this talk I will share learnings in building an internal R user community in a large global organization, via efforts including cataloging existing works, coordinating R adoption pilots and trainings, etc. In addition, I will share our experiences and challenges in building a streamlined workflow with an automated writing component to enhance efficiency and reproducibility in a recent health authority interaction, towarding our mission of bringing therapies to patients faster."

2019-08-22 - Thursday,3:20 PM - 3:30 PM,Auditorium,The use of R for improved reproducibility of biomarker detection in liquid biopsies,Vivian Zhuang,"Research reproducibility has been heatedly discussed in recent years. Some authors have pointed out that a large portion of published research findings is incorrect and/or irreproducible. Some state that the medical literature is as reliable as expected. Despite the true state of the research literature, we can agree that reproducibility is of greatest importance to biomarker detection, including in the context of drug discovery and development. Research reproducibility may become a challenge in the current research community, because of the interdisciplinary nature of modern studies and latent gaps between the advancement of technology and the ability to analyze the resulting data. In this presentation, we will describe the reproducibility challenges of biomarker detection in liquid biopsies, which hold prevalent promises in disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Our study shows that proper development and use of R packages can give a significant contribution to reproducible, high-quality, and cutting-edge research in nucleic acid biomarker detection, such as detection of novel circulating microRNA biomarkers."

2019-08-22 - Thursday,5:05 PM - 5:15 PM,Auditorium,Machine learning workflow management with drake,Will Landau,"Machine learning workflows can be difficult to manage. A single round of computation can take several hours to complete, and routine updates to the code and data tend to invalidate hard-earned results. You can enhance the maintainability, hygiene, speed, scale, and reproducibility of such projects with the drake R package. drake resolves the dependency structure of your analysis pipeline, skips tasks that are already up to date, executes the rest with optional distributed computing, and organizes the output so you rarely have to think about data files. This talk demonstrates a deep learning project with drake-powered automation."
2019-08-22 - Thursday,5:15 PM - 5:35 PM,Auditorium,"An R package for Data Science and ""Deep Visualization"" of a complex clinical database",David James,"We define and illustrate a ""deep visualization"" paradigm for the analysis of a relatively large and complex clinical database for psoriasis (PSO) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). This paradigm supports a growing number of machine learning and exploratory analyses, and it provides a framework for Shiny applications and dashboards used to communicate results with internal and external clinicians. Our R platform implements a ""whole-patient"" data view including omics, imaging, and hundreds of anatomical assessments (scores) on multiple tissues, such as skin, joints, bones, entheses, etc. The package makes extensive use of anatomical metadata objects implemented as reference classes (Chambers, 2016), both for computing over anatomical structures and for visualizing disease state both at specific anatomical locations and at the patient-level. We present examples including visualization of bone and joint structural damage assessment scores, clustering of patients according to their disease trajectories, and association of pain to clinical endpoints over time."

At satRday Chicago everyone in the audience said they used R Markdown, however only one person raised their hand when asked if they could associate their reports back to the code version that generated it. Since continuous integration is quickly becoming commonplace in the R community, continuous deployment (CD) is a logical and easy step to add to your workflow to enhance reproducibility. I will demo associating R Markdown to the code version that produced it and automating the build and release of both executable and cloud-based Shiny apps. Finally, an announcement of the electricShine package for creating Electron based Shiny apps will highlight the power of using CD with production-level Shiny apps."

2019-08-23 - Friday,11:10 AM - 11:30 AM,Auditorium,Building Open Source Tools for Safety Monitoring: Advancing Research Through Community Collaboration,Becca Krouse,"The Interactive Safety Graphics (ISG) workstream of the ASA-DIA Biopharm Safety Working Group is excited to introduce the safetyGraphics package: an interactive framework for evaluating clinical trial safety in R using a flexible data pipeline. Our group seeks to modernize clinical trial safety monitoring by building tools for data exploration and reporting in a highly collaborative open source environment. At present, our team includes clinical and technical representatives from the pharmaceutical industry, academia, and the FDA, and additional contributors are always welcome. The current release of the safetyGraphics R package includes graphics related to drug-induced liver injury. The R package is paired with an in-depth clinical workflow for monitoring liver function created by expert clinicians based on medical literature. safetyGraphics features interactive visualizations built using htmlwidgets, a Shiny application, and the ability to export a fully reproducible instance of the charts with associated source code. To ensure quality and accuracy, the package includes more than 300 unit tests, and it has been vetted through a beta testing process that included feedback from more than 20 clinicians and analysts. The Shiny application can easily be extended to include new charts or applied to other disease areas due to its modular design and generalized charting framework. Several companies have adapted the tool for their own use, leading to interesting discussions and paving the way for enhancements, which demonstrates the power of open source and community collaboration."
2019-08-23 - Friday,11:30 AM - 11:40 AM,Auditorium,"It's Not What's on the Outside, but It's What's on the Back-end That Matters: The World Beyond CSV Files",Marcus Adams,"Start browsing through R tutorials online and it won't take long to stumble across a read.csv statement. CSV files serve well for detached, static analyses. They tend fail, however, when tasked with storing large, dynamic data sets being accessed interactively by globally dispersed, concurrent users. Often the go to in this situation is a traditional relational database management system such as Oracle or MySQL, but there are other options! This talk will review the various back-ends, along with potential considerations, Merck's Digital Proactive Process Analytics group has implemented to support various Shiny applications, dashboards, and automated data analysis pipelines."
2019-08-23 - Friday,11:40 AM - 12:00 PM,Auditorium,Improve installation sequences for R package cohorts,Juliane Manitz,"The installation of a cohort of R packages can constitute a challenge; especially considering different dependency types, package versions, overlapping namespaces and varying risks assigned to each of the packages. At the same time, the number of R packages to be installed grows exponentially with each new package added. Their complex dependencies may create conflicts. In this context, the R admin is often confronted with a cohort of packages without knowing the package of interest. We use statistical analysis techniques from the field of complex network analysis in order to shed light into the non-trivial dependency structures of package cohorts. Furthermore, we simplify the network graph to find improved installation sequences for a pre-selected cohorts of R packages. We reduce large package cohorts to a sufficient shortlist of packages, whose installation automatically pulls in other packages via dependencies without causing conflicts. The build time of a library may be greatly reduced. As a byproduct, we generate a graph of the build on the exact dependency tree and actual versions used for auditing and change control in the regulated workflows. This strategy also allows for the identification of high-risk packages and their importance in the dependency tree."
2019-08-23 - Friday,12:00 PM - 12:10 PM,Auditorium,Evaluating the performance of advanced causal inference methods applied to healthcare claims data,Jessica Myers Franklin,"Cohort studies of treatments developed from healthcare claims often have hundreds of thousands of patients and up to several thousand measured covariates. Therefore, new causal inference methods that combine ideas from machine learning and causal inference may improve analysis of these studies by taking advantage of the wealth of information measured in claims. In order to evaluate the performance of these methods as applied to claims-based studies, we use a combination of real data examples and plasmode simulation, implemented in R package 'plasmode', which creates realistic simulated datasets based on a real cohort study. In this talk, I will give an overview of our progress so far and what is left to be done."

For example, if a new data point is substantially different from the training set, its predicted value may be suspect. In chemistry, it is not uncommon to create an ""applicability domain"" model that measures the amount of potential extrapolation from the training set. The applicable package will be used to demonstrate different method to measure how much a new data point is an extrapolation from the original data (if at all)."
2019-08-23 - Friday,1:50 PM - 2:00 PM,Auditorium,Accelerating Chemistry Research through the Integration of Data Science with High-Throughput Experimentation,Jason Stevens,The development of a streamlined data-aggregation methodology utilizing the statistical programming language R is described. The centralization of high-throughput experimentation data enabled the use of statistics and data exploration methods within R to accelerate the identification and optimization of chemical reactions.

2019-08-23 - Friday,2:20 PM - 2:30 PM,Auditorium,Shiny apps for accelerating early drug discovery research,Gordon Turner,"Scientists in drug discovery research utilize a wide variety of instrumentation and techniques to advance their research. While instrumentation vendors often provide software tools to deal with data wrangling and visualization, a simple collection of isolated tools often fails to address the scale and overall scope of the data analysis encountered in discovery research. This can lead to lost productivity as scientists work to process, collate and summarize their work across various informatics systems. Shiny has seen increasing use in Pharma clinical research. On the other hand, Shiny apps are also transforming discovery research by putting powerful data wrangling, visualization and reporting tools into the hands of bench scientists. To solve the aforementioned problems in drug discovery research, we developed a suite of tools using Shiny to automate data wrangling, integration, visualization and reporting. Examples will be presented in areas such as automated signal processing and batch analysis of electrocardiogram data, collection and visualization of biomarker and physiology measurements from pharmacology studies, and access to a high performance computation cluster for non-experts. These Shiny tools and have shown value by increasing productivity and accelerating scientific research."
2019-08-23 - Friday,2:30 PM - 2:50 PM,Auditorium,Using R to foster the communication with non-statisticians on Bayesian dose escalation models,Marianna Grinberg,"Bayesian model-based dose-escalation designs, including one and two parameter logistic regression models, have meanwhile proven themselves in Phase I dose-escalation trials (Iasonos and O'Quigley, 2014 [1]). Compared to rule/algorithm-based designs such as the 3+3 design, model-based designs have the advantage of being more flexible in choosing the target toxicity rate and cohort size. Bayesian modeling allows to combine prior knowledge of the drug (e.g. from animal tox studies, data from comparator drugs or data from other studies) with the observed data from the current trial. The model-based approach accounts for uncertainty, optimize dose recommendations (balance of risk versus benefit for patients) and allows for dose de-escalation as well as dose re-escalation. Recent research has shown that model-based approaches are more reliable in estimating the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and allocating less patients to ineffective or excessively toxic doses (Jaki et al., 2019 [2]). Because of their higher complexity, model-based designs are still seen critical among clinicians (Le Tourneau et al., 2012 [3]), thus the classical 3+3 design is still widely implemented due to its simplicity and transparency. Conaway et al., 2019 [4] have highlighted that the choice of design in early phase affects the outcome of the drug development process, therefore more attention should be paid to early-stage designs. In this talk we will showcase how we bring Bayesian dose-escalation models closer to non-statisticians by means of R. We will discuss how we plan, implement and communicate the dose-escalation design to the clinicians. Moreover, we show how we present our results to the safety monitoring committee (SMC) and how we support the SMC in dose escalation decisions. We use a simple data example to illustrate the proposed methodology. All will be discussed within the context of using R as primary tool. [1] Iasonos, A. and O'Quigley, J (2014).

2019-08-23 - Friday,2:50 PM - 3:00 PM,Auditorium,Prediction of maternal-fetal exposures of CYP450-metabolized drugs using physiologic pharmacokinetic modeling implemented in R and mrgsolve.,Madeleine S. Gastonguay,"Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models are used extensively in drug development to address of number of problems. However, most PBPK applications have limited knowledge sharing impact because they are implemented in closed, proprietary software. Much of the physiologic data and knowledge required for these models is publically available or available in the pre-competitive space. To this end, we've engaged in the development of open science PBPK models, using R as the scaffolding for this work. In particular, our group has developed the mrgsolve R package which utilizes Rcpp to compile models of systems of ordinary differential equations. One example is the development of a PBPK model to predict maternal/fetal exposures for drugs that are primarily metabolized by liver CYP450 enzymes throughout pregnancy. This model aims to utilize a quantitative understanding of the physiological and biochemical changes that occur throughout pregnancy to inform clinical pharmacology decisions where clinical trials cannot. The model was validated against the observed data of 5 different drugs: midazolam, metoprolol, caffeine, nevirapine, and artemether. A series of local sensitivity analyses followed by parameter optimization further improved model predictions using the mrgsolve and nloptr R packages. The developed maternal-fetal PBPK model in its flexible open-source implementation provides a transparent, platform-independent, and reproducible system for model-informed decision support while developing exposure-based dosing recommendations in maternal/fetal patient populations."

We think a lot about how design choices affect immediate outcomes. GSK's Quantitative Decision Making (QDM) framework focusses on the question, ""How do we design our study in order to increase the chances that it will deliver data that will allow us to decide whether the drug should continue in development, or stop?"" The QDM Framework has been developed in R and takes advantage of the Biostatistics HPC environment, running thousands of hypothetical scenarios in close to real-time. The initiative is changing the way we plan and deliver clinical trials. Thanks to a Shiny front end, Statisticians are able to walk clinical teams through key trial design decisions in order to estimate the Probability of Success – a key component in the QDM framework. This presentation will cover the core QDM concepts and present the key communication outputs created to support the process."

2019-08-23 - Friday,4:45 PM - 5:05 PM,Auditorium,Shiny in Production: Building bridges from data science to IT,Kelly O'Briant,"We know that adopting documentation, testing, and version control mechanisms are important for creating a culture of reproducibility in data science. But once you've embraced some basic development best practices, what comes next? What does it take to feel confident that our data products will make it to production? This talk will cover case studies in how I work with R users at various organizations to bridge the gaps that form between development and production. I'll cover reasons why CI/CD tools can enhance reproducibility for R and data science, showcase practical examples like automated testing and push-based application deployment, and point to simple resources for getting started with these tools in a number of different environments."
